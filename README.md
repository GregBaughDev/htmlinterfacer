# HTMLInterfacer

## About
  
HTMLInterfacer is a standalone GUI application which allows static HTML files stored in a GitHub repo to be edited
in a WYSIWYG editor. Similar to a text editor, it allows anyone to update the content, commit the changes
and open a PR, without having to have a working knowledge of Git or IDEs.
